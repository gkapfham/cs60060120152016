\subsection*{Grading}

Final grades are determined by vote of the entire faculty of the Department of Computer Science, not just the course instructor
for CMPSC 600 or CMPSC 610.

Your grade in CMPSC 600 will be based on a combination of the following activities and deliverables. Percentages are not
given because we recognize that the senior thesis experience differs from one student to the next and that there are many
variables, such as the nature of the project and the availability of external resources, that can influence the relative
importance of these criteria. However, it is important to note that a large percentage of your grade depends upon your
written proposal, your proposal defense, and your two chapters.

% Using the aforementioned deadlines as a framework, work
% with your first reader to establish a schedule of deadlines appropriate to your project and then adhere to this
% schedule.

\subsection*{Course Expectations and Deliverables --- CMPSC 600}

\medskip
\noindent{\bf Participation.} Once your readers have been assigned, you must regularly meet with your first reader, who
will report on your participation when the department's faculty meet to assign grades.  Students are expected to come to
each meeting with a status update on their progress and a meeting agenda.  Students should conclude each meeting by
listing the tasks that they want to complete before the next meeting. Evidence of regular meetings must be submitted
to the course instructor.

\medskip
\noindent{\bf Proposal.}
The proposal should follow the department's proposal style and thus must include an abstract, the main body of your
proposal, a tentative schedule for completing the project, a bibliography, and any other information deemed important by
your first reader. This will often include one or more of the following: a survey of the existing literature; an overview of
your proposed technique; the description of an evaluation method; examples or code artifacts or evidence that you
understand the nature of the work you are proposing and can feasibly complete it in the time available.
The proposal must adhere to professional standards of writing. Your first reader will make suggestions on your submitted
drafts; students are expected to revise multiple proposal drafts.

% You must adhere
% to professional standards of writing---
%
% your first reader will make suggestions on your submitted drafts about how to
% improve your proposal.  Expect to do a number of revisions.
%

You must work at a pace that will ensure that your first reader can formally approve the final draft of you thesis
proposal before the stated deadline.  Failure to secure formal approval of your thesis proposal before this date will
result in the reduction of your final grade in CMPSC 600.

% Failure to finish this task before the deadline will result in the reduction of your final grade in CMPSC 600.

\medskip
\noindent{\bf Proposal Defense.}
A proposal defense is a prepared, formal presentation of about ten minutes in which you lay out the essential parts of
your chosen project under the assumption that your first and second reader have studied your proposal.  Following the
presentation that is supported by polished slides, you will participate in a discussion with your readers to identify
potential problems, refine or modify some aspects of the project proposal, and ensure that your project is feasible
and appropriate. All aspects of your proposal defense should be prepared in consultation with your first reader.
You must schedule your proposal defense before the stated deadline. Your grade in CMPSC 600 will be reduced if you miss the
deadline for scheduling or conducting your defense.

% This will be
% followed by a discussion with your readers to identify
%
% potential problems, refine or modify some aspects of the project
% proposal, and insure that your project is a feasible and appropriate one. {\em You should prepare your proposal defense
% in cooperation with your first reader.}
%

\medskip
\noindent{\bf Thesis Chapters.} Your two chapters, due on the previously stated date, should represent a
significant addition to or extension of the material in your proposal. Don't simply ``split the proposal into two
chapters'' --- this usually does not work well since your chapters represent work completed, not work being proposed.
Chapters are judged according to the same professional standards as the proposal; they must include a full bibliography, a
preliminary table of contents, lists of any figures and tables, and any other items required by your first reader.

As you write your chapters in consultation with your first and second reader, allow these individuals to comment on your
drafts and then make all of their requested changes.  Plan to write several drafts of the chapters before submitting them
on the due date; failure to submit the chapters by the stated deadline will result in the reduction of your final grade
in CMPSC 600.

\vspace*{-.2in}
\subsection*{Course Expectations and Deliverables --- CMPSC 610}

% \medskip
\noindent{\bf Participation.} You must regularly meet with your first reader, who will report on your participation when
the department's faculty meet to assign grades.  Students are expected to come to each meeting with a status update on
their progress and a meeting agenda.  Students should conclude each meeting by listing the tasks that they want to
complete before the next meeting. Evidence of regular meetings must be submitted to the course instructor at the end
of the semester.

% {\bf It is your obligation} to regularly meet with your first reader,
% who will report on your participation when the Department faculty
% meet to assign grades.
%

	% This allows the month of April for you to schedule  and present a thesis defense, make any required changes to your
	% thesis, and submit final copies for binding no later than the end of the final exam period (and preferably much
	% earlier).


\medskip
\noindent{\bf Written Thesis.} In consultation with your first reader and in accordance with the stated deadlines, you
must work out a schedule for completion of your thesis research and your written document. All senior theses are due,
properly formatted and signed (but not bound), on the stated due date. 	Your thesis should both follow the department's
style and adhere to professional standards of writing. You are expected to work closely with your first reader in the
creation of this document.  Your grade in CMPSC 610 will be reduced if you fail to submit your unbound thesis on time.

Following your defense, you must submit the bound copy of your senior thesis by the aforementioned due date.  This
document must incorporate any changes that were requested by your first and second reader. Seniors who have not
delivered the signed and appropriately bound copies of their senior thesis by the stated deadline will receive an
incomplete and will not graduate.

\medskip
\noindent{\bf Thesis Defense.} The standards for this presentation are the same as for the proposal defense ---  you
must give a ten minute presentation supported by polished slides and adhere to all of the other stated requirements.
Part of your grade will depend on how well you are able to discuss aspects of your thesis, including implications of
your work, connections between your research and other areas of computer science, and possible extensions or
improvements of your research ideas.  You are expected to work with your first reader in preparing your oral defense.
Your grade in CMPSC 610 will be reduced if you do not schedule or conduct your thesis defense by the stated deadlines.

% \noindent{\bf Late Policy}
% Failure to meet the deadlines above will incur a late penalty to be decided by
% the faculty of the Department of Computer Science.
%
% The following policy was adopted by
%the entire computer science department, effective beginning in fall of 2004:
